	<p>The Rose Street Community Center is a 501c3 non-profit organization located in East Baltimore. It provides a continuum of social services within the Baltimore City region to Baltimore Residents. Rose Street services include short-term emergency and transitional housing, medical, mental health and case management services, education, gang intervention and prevention and referrals to other community service providers.</p>

	<p>Since February 2000, with support from The Abell Foundation, the Rose Street Community Center (Rose Street) has offered small weekly stipends (no more than $10 a day) to community residents in exchange for participating in daily community clean-ups, GED classes, or gang mediation meetings. Last year, Rose Street served more than 100 people per week, with nearly half of those residing in R ose Street's nine transitional houses.</p>

	<p>Compared to other transitional housing programs, Rose Street serves those most often turned away by other programs: those with violent crime histories. Men who are unemployed and reside in the houses participate in community cleanups, removing as much as nine tons of trash from the community each week. Once the men secure employment, Rose Street staff assists them in obtaining permanent housing.</p>

	<p>The 100 Blocks Homicide-Free Zone (see facebook.com/thepeaceisalreadyinyou) is a special project of the Rose Street Community Center. This is an area where the need for professional policing has been eliminated by a unique version of “community policing.” This type of community policing involves encouragement of the peace by the young men of the community. Each of the young men involved in the project is responsible for one block in the local community and is paid a stipend of $10 a week. He must live on or adjacent to this block and be a resident who carries the respect of his fellow residents, so that when a violent incident is ripening, he can take steps to gently encourage a peaceful resolution. Essentially, it has been an effort “ahead of the curve” in terms of addressing what is currently referred to in the media as “black-ion-black violence.</p>

	<p>We have had as many as 74 Blocks covered, but due to limited funding for stipends, we have had to cut back to 66. Between January 2014 and January 2015 we had only 2 homicides on the blocks our young men covered. In past years, there could have been as many as 15 or 20. Our efforts made a significant, but unacknowledged contribution to the lowest Baltimore city-wide half-year homicide rate in 30 years.</p>

	Recently, the 100 Blocks Homicide-Free Zone has expanded its mission to address the 30+-year-long menace of police misconduct and abuse in the community. Participants are currently gathering written and video documentation of police misconduct and abuse as evidence to support a class action suit against the Baltimore City Police Department and, hopefully, the local Fraternal Order of Police Lodge.</p>
